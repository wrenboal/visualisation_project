# Project on  Business Profit Analysis, Forecast & Visualisation

## Overview
In this project, a dataset on business transactions in 2024 was given and I was tasked to analyse it and suggest recommendations to increase profitability in Q1 2025, using effective data visualisations. All tasks were performed on Microsoft Excel.

## Handling missing data
To address missing values in the profit column of the given dataset, I implemented linear regression to predict monthly profit of the same product. I created a visualisation [Missing_data_imputation_plot.png](./Missing_data_imputation_plot.png) to communicate this imputation method, using matching colours for pieces of information that should be read together.

## Profit forecast
Linear regression was used to forecast Q1 2025 profit [Profit_forecast_plot.png](./Profit_forecast_plot.png)

## Key countries
To highlight the countries with the highest and lowest contributions to the businessâ€™s annual profit, another visualiation was created [Key_countries_plot.png](./Key_countries_plot.png). Colour coding was used for quick comprehension.. Colour coding was used for quick comprehension.

## Recommended strategies
Finally, strategic recommendations were identified: 
- mitigate projected declines in large markets,
- anticipate and leverage the growth of an emerging market, and
- maintaining sales in minor markets which were collectively responsible for nearly half of total annual profit.
- For this, a visualisation for the top markets and an emerging market was first shown [Recommendation_plot_1.png](./Recommendation_plot_1.png). Following this, another visualisation was shown where the minor markets were added [Recommendation_plot_2.png](./Recommendation_plot_2.png). The colour of top and emerging markets was lightened to shift the visual attention to the minor markets without losing the comparison.
